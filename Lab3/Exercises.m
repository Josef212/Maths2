% Let {A}, {B} and {C}, be 3 different reference frames. From them we know
% that:
%      - The origin of B with respect A is
oAB = [3,1,-2]';
%      - The origin of C with respect B is
oBC = [-3, 1,-2]';

% The three frames has different orientations in space.
% In fact:
%       -The set of Euler angles stored in eta as eta = (psi,theta,phi)
eta = [25;145;30]; % Expressed in degrees
%            represents 3 consecutive rotations about z, y, and x
%            respectively that allows to transform from {A} to {B}
%
%       - The quaternion
q = 1/7*[-sqrt(3)*3.5;3;-1;-1.5];
%         will allows to express in {B} a vector defined in {C}, if {C} and {B}
%         had the same origin

%   -Let in addition v1 and v2 to be points which coordinates are known in
%   {C}.
v1_C = [0;2;0];
v2_C = [0;2;5];

% With the information provided above determine:
%
%   2.1- The affine expression (no matrix here!) that allows to relate a vector originally given
%       in {C} to {B}.
%
%   2.2 The affine matrix that allows to express a vector originally given
%       in {C} to {A}.
%
%   2.3 The vectors v1_C and v2_C forms a segment. Make a 3d plot (plot3() in
%   matlab), representing how the segment is seen on {A} in red, on {B} in
%   blue and on {C} in green.

% Make use of the provided function quatmult to multiply quaternions.




%% Exercise 3.
display('Exercise 3 =================');
% The points described by the columns of the matrix A

% are points contained into a circle, and they are defined in a world frame W.

% A camera is situated at point

cc = [1; 6; 1];

% defined in the world frame. Moreover the orientation of this camera frame
% is achieved by rotating the world frame -90 degs about its y axis followed by -20
% degrees about the resulting z axis.

%If the camera has a focal length of 1/34 m:

% 3.1 Make a plot with the view of the points of the circle projected into the camera plane.
%
% 3.2 Make also a 3D plot where all the scene is drawn in the world
% coordinates. The scene must contain the 2 reference frames (2 orthogonal sets of vectors)
% and the circle points. You can use the provided function cameraproj.


%% Exercise 4
display('Exercise 4 =================');
%The columns of the next matrix, represents the coordinates od 4 points
%defined in a world frame.

A = load('AEx4.mat');
A = A.A;

%From this 4 points, two segments are defined. The segment one, goes from
% the point defined by the first column to the point defined by the second
% column. The second segment is defined by the other two points.

% A camera frame is seeing the scene. The origin of the world frame seen
% from the camera frame is given by the vector

wc = [4.665;3.735;-0.5395];


%And the orientation of the camera frame is obtained after rotating the
%world frame -170 degs about the direction
u = [0.01;-.2;1];


% With the data provided determine:
%
% 4.1 The minimum angle that both segments forms (hint, they intersect)
%
% 4.2 The angle that both segments forms in the image plane
%
% 4.3 Deliver a 3D representation of the scene with all the coordinates
% refered to the world frame
%
% 4.4 Deliver the 3D scene representations but with all the coordinates
% refered to the camera frame
